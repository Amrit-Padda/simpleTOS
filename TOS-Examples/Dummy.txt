Facebook Commercial Terms
The Facebook Terms and these terms (the �Facebook Commercial Terms� or �Commercial Terms�) apply to access or use of the Facebook Products (or Products), including Facebook Business Tools, for any business or commercial purpose (except where we state that separate terms (and not these) apply to such access or use of a Facebook Product). This includes, but is not limited to, buying ads, selling products, developing apps, managing a group or Page for a business, or using our measurement services.
You agree that you will ensure that any third party on whose behalf you access or use any Facebook Product for any business or commercial purpose (except, again, where we state that separate terms (and not these) apply to such access or use) is bound by the Terms, these Commercial Terms and any applicable supplemental terms, and you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that third party to such terms.
These Commercial Terms require the resolution of most disputes between you and us by binding arbitration on an individual basis; class actions and jury trials are not permitted.
Note: we have updated the Statement of Rights and Responsibilities, including changing its name to the Facebook Terms of Service. For purposes of these Commercial Terms, references in existing terms or agreements to (i) �the Statement of Rights and Responsibilities,� �Statement,� or �SRR,� shall now mean the Facebook Terms or Terms and (ii) �Facebook� (when used to refer to our products and services) or �Facebook Services� or �Services� shall now mean Facebook Products.

    Licenses: As described in �The permissions you give us� section in our Terms, you grant us a license to content that is covered by intellectual property rights (like photos or videos) you share, post, or upload on or in connection with our Products. For any access or use of the Facebook Products for business or commercial purposes, that license applies to content you or someone on your behalf (such as your agency that places an ad for you or your service provider that manages your Page content for you) makes available on or in connection with any Facebook Product.

    You also will ensure that you own or have secured all rights necessary to grant the licenses and rights you (or someone on your behalf) grant to us under the Commercial Terms and any applicable supplemental terms, including permission to display, distribute and deliver your content within Facebook Products.

    Compliance with law: You represent and warrant that your access or use of Facebook Products for business or commercial purposes complies with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations. You further represent that you will restrict access to your content and apps in accordance with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, including geo-filtering or age-gating access where required.

    In addition to and without limiting the requirements about who can use the Facebook Products under our Terms, if you are located in a country that is subject to embargo under the laws of the United States (or under similar laws applicable to you) you may not engage in commercial activities on Facebook Products unless authorized by applicable laws. If you are on the U.S. Treasury Department�s list of Specially Designated Nationals (or an equivalent lists), you may not engage in commercial or business activities on the Facebook Products (such as advertising or payments). You also may not access or use the Facebook Products if you are prohibited from receiving products, services, or software under applicable law.

    Limits on liability: In addition to and without limiting the scope of the �Limits on liability� section in our Terms, you agree that we are not responsible for the actions, services, content, or data of third parties and you release us, our directors, officers, employees, and agents from any claims and damages, known or unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with any claim you have against any such third parties.

    If you are a California resident, you agree to waive California Civil Code � 1542, which says:

    A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.

    Our aggregate liability arising out of or relating to any access or use of the Facebook Products for business or commercial purposes, the Terms (for any access or use of the Facebook Products for business or commercial purposes), or these Commercial Terms shall not exceed the greater of one hundred dollars ($100) or the amount you have paid us in the past twelve months.
